<title>CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.</title>

I think <claim>some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes</claim>. <claim>It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right.</claim> <logos>Radicalism almost always leads to violence</logos>, and <pathos>is a plague on democratic society and governments</pathos>. Since <logos>communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries<logos>, <claim>the far-left has for the most part been dealt with</claim>. However <claim>the far-right continues to be a menace.</claim>

I believe <claim>fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right</claim>. <logos>These groups are always extreme fringes</logos>, and <pathos>a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.</pathos>

 <pathos>Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed</pathos>, <pathos>using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.</pathos>

<claim>Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand</claim>. <logos>On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers.</logos> <claim>Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?</claim>

<claim>Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them</claim> <logos>since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate.</logos> <claim>I see this as a major flaw in democracy.</claim> <logos>Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.</logos>

Instead, I think <claim>governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism.</claim> <pathos>After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies.</pathos>

<claim>Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples.</claim> <claim>These bad apples need to be weeded out.</claim> <pathos>Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.</pathos>

 As other's said, <claim>who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are.</claim>  Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details.

&gt;Zero tolerance, whatever it takes.
<logos>Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism and their poison should be kept out of the minds of children.</logos> <logos>Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination.</logos>
<logos>In a highly connected online era, it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement.</logos> <logos>When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem.</logos>
 <logos>The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough.</logos>

Now, this is obviously extreme, but you see how such <claim>an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness.</claim>

The thing is though, <claim>what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective.</claim>

<logos>Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.</logos>

I don't disagree, but on principle <claim>who gets to define what being a reasonable person is?</claim>  <logos>Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous, and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable.</logos> <logos>Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office.</logos>

Well we have the benefit of history. The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.

In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out. Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia weren't all that stable.

&gt;Well we have the benefit of history.

 So did they.  <claim>Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves.</claim>  <logos>Ever heard of the Reign of Terror?</logos>

&gt;The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.

<claim>And who gets to decide what being a moderate was, and why is it tied to what the majority wants?</claim>  <logos>Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives</logos>, and <pathos>throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit.</pathos>
 
&gt;In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out.

<claim>Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening?</claim>  <logos>It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas.</logos>  Also, <pathos>stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things.</pathos>  <logos>100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee.</logos>

 <claim>But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ?</claim> <logos>Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.</logos>

I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. <claim>However this isn't about being just a bit conservative.</claim> <pathos>It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.</pathos>

&gt;But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.

 <logos>People thought the exact same thing before WWI.</logos> <logos>They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years.</logos>  <claim>And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it</claim> <logos>considering what's happening in the middle east.</logos>  <logos>Hell, Rwanda wasn't that long ago either.</logos> <logos>And even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented.</logos>

&gt;I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.

 <logos>One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter.</logos> <logos>One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture.</logos>  <logos>One person's murderer is a other's soldier.</logos>  <logos>Now, I don't think all these comparisons are true, but they certainly aren't hard to make.</logos>  <logos>And they certainly have been made throughout history.</logos>

&gt;Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.

Exactly, my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that <claim>what is considered moderate and okay changes.</claim> <claim>It isn't some objective fact about people.</claim>  <logos>J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought.</logos>  The point is <logos>what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone</logos>, and <claim>to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction (either failing to get bad people or getting good people)</claim>

Your first paragraph is intriguing, and I definitely agree with it. The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective. Although I do think <claim>more needs to be done to combat extremism</claim>, I see where you're coming from on this.
