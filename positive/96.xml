Really though. <logos>There is an unchecked organization that spies on them 24/7 without consent.</logos> <logos>The US has given itself license to detain and torture citizens with no trial.</logos> <logos>The energy laws in that country allow corporations to drill where they please and, as a result, poison who they please.</logos> <logos>American citizens have clearly been lied to in many situations.</logos> <logos>These lies have led to events like the second gulf war.</logos> <pathos>Not to mention the completely unregulated financial system.</pathos>

<logos>Honestly, none of these things have been democratically voted for, so why are Americans so deluded about this?</logos> <claim>It's not a free, democratic society by any means.</claim> <claim>It's clearly an oligarchy</claim>

<claim>A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.</claim> <logos>The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy.</logos> To see if it actually *is* one (at least the "republic" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions.

<logos>Is political power in the US held by elected officials?</logos>

<logos>Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections?</logos>

  <logos>The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously "yes."</logos> <logos>The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution.</logos> <logos>And we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail.</logos>

You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state, <claim>but it remains by definition a democratic one.</claim>

Fair enough haha. This is the best argument I've seen here

  Edit: <claim>but how can you have truly fair elections if things like superpacs exist?</claim>

What's your basis for believing that SuperPACs make elections un-free or un-fair?

<reply id="cn5toxz" author="Smelly_Bob">
  Well in my brain <logos>a fair election is when anyone can run for office.</logos> <pathos>The fact that you need millions of dollars to do so seems unfair.</pathos> <logos>It instantly results in a situation where only the rich can run for and hold offices.</logos> On the municipal level I don't think superpacs are a problem, but <logos>definitely on a federal level.</logos>

  <logos>Anyone *can* run for office. You might not get very far, but you can run.</logos> <logos>And you don't need millions of dollars, you need to be *able to raise* millions of dollars.</logos>
Glad this has been a productive discussion. If your view has indeed been changed, please draw your attention to "The delta (âˆ†) system" in the sidebar and award me one delta. 

  The reason I think <claim>this is important</claim> is because <pathos>I'm pissed off about the way things are in America, as I'm sure you are, and I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is.</pathos> <claim>America's problem isn't that it isn't a democracy; rather, I think that America's problem is that it has fetishized democracy</claim> <pathos>to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it's corrupt and tyrannical, and that's exactly what it's turning into.</pathos> No, we're probably never going to get money out of politics entirely, <logos>but corporations being able to anonymously fund entire campaigns is a major threat to healthy government</logos>, even if it isn't, strictly speaking, un-democratic.

A delta for you then! (I'm new, so sorry in advance if I mess it up)

Maybe I put forward the wrong view, but I think you and I more or less agree that <claim>their is something fetid in the system</claim>. <pathos>I get tired of seeing people worship at the altar of the US flag</pathos> - <logos>they seem blind to what the US government is really about.</logos>
Cheers!
