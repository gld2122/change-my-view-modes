For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities; IMO <claim>the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population.</claim>

<claim>With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).</claim> <logos>A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.</logos> <logos>I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.</logos> <logos>(maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below.)</logos>

<claim>I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children.</claim> CMV.

I had parents who were extremely persistent about making sure i stayed on track. I was only recently diagnosed with adhd a reading disability and im 20 years old. I graduated on time but i struggled so much. I failed a bunch of stuff and was constantly embarrassed to show my grades to other people. I lost hope often because things felt hopeless, which lead teachers, doctors, family and other students to think i just didnt care.   

  <logos>An issue is there are a ton of people with "disabilities" more so than you'd think.</logos> <logos>Thats because we teach everyone to think the same way.</logos>

  <claim>Thats the issue.</claim> <logos>Im really good at doing certain things.</logos> For example, <logos>i can read , write, and even speak backwards pretty well.</logos> <logos>My brain is wired differently.</logos>

<logos>I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant.</logos> <logos>It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid.</logos> <claim>THAT is the issue.</claim> <claim>Everyone has a mind that works in its own way.</claim>

<claim>The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system.</claim>

<claim>Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for "dumb" kids is the problem.</claim>

<logos>Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids and thats because its not tapping into their mind right.</logos>

<logos>If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus.</logos>

&gt;I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant. It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid. THAT is the issue. Everyone has a mind that works in its own way.

  Yes. I think <logos>that builds my initial point.</logos> <claim>Parents should be educated on how to identify *how* their child's mind works.</claim> <logos>This is what I meant when I said "100%" on the parents.</logos> <logos>You're parents would've known how to turn the way your mind worked into a successful academic career, in a perfect world.</logos>
