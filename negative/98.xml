<title>CMV: I believe that regularly browsing 4chan will make you into a worse person</title>

<OP author="InsaneTeaparty">
<logos>Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.</logos> They will care about how people respond to them, but <logos>since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.</logos>

  <pathos>Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality</pathos>, and <logos>people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group.</logos> <logos>Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.</logos>

<logos>On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof.</logos> <logos>Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact.</logos>
<pathos>It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.</pathos>

<claim>Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.</claim>

<logos>I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative, but that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site.</logos>

<logos>Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.</logos>

<ethos>I got the idea about "being around negative thinking will affect you negatively" from the book "Directional Thinking" by Benjamin Chapin.</ethos>

okay. I sort of agree with you. Was just curious if there had been any research you knew of
